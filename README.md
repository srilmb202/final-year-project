 Title : Detection of Marine Algae Distributions using Satellite Imagery <br><br>
 Abstract : <br>
 This project employs Landsat 8 satellite data and machine learning techniques to predict seaweed(Marine Algae) distribution in two regions around India over a span of five 
 years. Utilizing Earth Explorer's Bands 4 (Red), Band 5 (Near Infrared), and Band 6 (Short wave Infrared), the focus lies on extracting crucial indices such as NDVI, FAI, and 
 SEI. The supervised learning model, trained and validated on this extensive dataset, reveals intricate temporal patterns, showcasing distinct seasonal variations in seaweed 
 activity. Environmental factors influencing seaweed growth are considered, enhancing our ability to predict future trends and anticipate potential ecological shifts. The study 
 pioneers an integrated approach, seamlessly combining satellite imagery, advanced image processing, and machine learning techniques, providing valuable predictive insights, and 
 fostering a deeper understanding of the seaweed growth dynamics. These insights gained contribute significantly to the broader field of marine ecology, providing a holistic 
 intuition of temporal trends and influencing factors in seaweed abundance across the specified regions named Dwaraka and Vijaydurg.
